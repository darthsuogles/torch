#+TITLE: Self-contained Torch installation

To keep updated with the latest upstream, please use run =update.sh= followed by =install.sh=.
We keep a modified =luajit-rocks= repository.

If you use the excellent =modules= management package, please run =gen_modules_torch.sh=.
It will generate a module file and put it under your local =MODULEPATH=.

To install any torch packages, call
#+begin_src sh 
luarocks install <package_name>
#+end_src

* First Time Installation
Install dependencies. Uses `apt-get` on Ubuntu, which might require `sudo`. Uses `brew` on OSX.
